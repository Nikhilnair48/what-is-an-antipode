## What is an antipode?

Given a latitude and longitude, an antipode is the exact opposite location on Earth.

## To run the project

1. git clone git@github.com:Nikhilnair48/what-is-an-antipode.git
2. cd what-is-an-antipode
3. node api.js
4. npm install && npm start

### Note on testing

- api.js will run on port 8080 while the web app will run on port 3000. Disable CORS on the browser to ensure smooth testing; alternatively, use an extension such as [CORS Unblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en) to test.

- Though responsive, the app hasn't been optimied for mobile. Testing on desktop is recommended.
